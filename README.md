# PowerBI_Project
This is a self PowerBI project on the overview of the car sales.

Problem Statement and Description of the Project.

Background: Our company is a car dealership that sells various car models. To effectively track and analyse our sales performance, we need a comprehensive Car Sales Dashboard in Power BI. 
Objective: The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard will visualize critical KPIs related to our car sales, helping us understand our sales performance over time and make data-driven decisions.
Problem Statement 1: KPIâ€™s Requirement
The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to our sales data. This will enable us to make informed decisions, monitor our progress, and identify trends and opportunities for growth.
1)Sales Overview:
>Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales
>Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales
>Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales
>Difference between YTD Sales and Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Sales

2)Average Price Analysis:
>YTD Average Price
>MTD Average Price
>YOY Growth in Average Price
>Difference between YTD Average Price and PTYD Average Price

3)Cars Sold Metrics:
>YTD Cars Sold
>MTD Cars Sold
>YOY Growth in Cars Sold
>Difference between YTD Cars Sold and PTYD Cars Sold


Problem Statement 2: Charts Requirement


1)YTD Sales Weekly Trend: Display a line chart illustrating the weekly trend of YTD sales. The X-axis should represent weeks, and the Y-axis should show the total sales amount.
2)YTD Total Sales by Body Style: Visualize the distribution of YTD total sales across different car body styles using a Pie chart.
3)YTD Total Sales by Color: Present the contribution of various car colors to the YTD total sales through a pie chart.
4)YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region: Showcase the YTD sales data based on different dealer regions using a map chart to visualize the sales distribution geographically.
5)Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form: Provide a tabular grid that displays the sales trend for each company. The grid should showcase the company name along with their YTD sales figures.
6)Details Grid Showing All Car Sales Information: Create a detailed grid that presents all relevant information for each car sale, including car model, body style, colour, sales amount, dealer region, date, etc


Short Explanation of the Overview of the Project.

> This is an Interactive Dynamic Dashboard on car sales whcih you can download the file from the github and view it on the POWERBI Desktop Application and the excel data is also provided.
> It has multiple measures in a single KPI (Key Performance Indicator) like YTD total sales, difference between current year sales and previous sales year, growth in the sales of the car(year to year)with respect to the previous year and what is the growth percentage.
> Data Visualisation on the YTD sales Trend.
> Visualisations of the Pie Charts on YTD total sales by body style and Color.
> We can also visualise on YTD Cars sold by dealer region and Company Wise Sales Trend.
> Also important point to remember is that this Year to Date, Month To Date are all Time Intelligence DAX queries which are imporatant to power queries on time related data.
>We have used different kind of Filters to make the Dashboard more Interactive.
> There is second Dashboard which has the grid view of the car sales like Car, Dealer Name, Company, Total Sales etc.
> We have used Navigator Filter to switch between two Dashboard.
>Though I have added little Explanation on this project, it was an above Intermediate project which was comprehensive inorder to submit authentic information to the clients dynamically.
> Overall through this project I was able to learn Data Modelling, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, build calender tables, use of various filters and most important writing DAX queries on Time Intelligence Functions.
